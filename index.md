# CODEZILLA

## About Us
Codezilla is a club for those who see things from a different perspective - the Contributors. We welcome anyone who has the drive to work, learn and contribute to the betterment of the world. We focus on the introduction and implementation of cutting-edge technology by organising seminars and contributing to opensource.

## Our Mission
Codezilla has a place for all who strive to learn and work towards a better world. We aim to:
- Introduce and implement cutting-edge technology via seminars, discussion panels, and workshops
- Prepare students for the professional world by encouraging and enabling them to solve challenging real-time problems
- Enhance the overall growth of students through both theoretical and practical means

## Our Vision
Codezilla promotes OpenSource by providing a platform that enriches the culture of code and collaboration. We help students gain skills beyond the curriculum, kickstart innovative projects, and empower creative minds.

Report violations by sending a report to the community heads via our official email (codezillaclub@gmail.com) with evidence of the transgression. These reports will be reviewed and investigated in due time in an unbiased manner. Note that we regard repeated false accusations as spam.

Based on the circumstances, our course of action may be:
